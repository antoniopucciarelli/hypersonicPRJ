# hypersonicPRJ

This project simulates the **Schiapparelli** descend on Mars. 

The descend has been modeled using **SPARTA** code. 

## Simulation

The simulated cases are the following:

| Case 		| Mesh 	| Description  					| Output 						   |
|---		|--- 	|---						|---							   |
| basicCase     | 3D	| C \& O based molecules simulation 	| C<sub>L</sub> \& C<sub>D</sub> analysis with respect to Kn and AOA |
| extendedCase	| 3D	| C, O, N \& e<sup>-</sup> based molecules simlation 	| C<sub>L</sub> \& C<sub>D</sub> analysis with respect to Kn and AOA |

The results of the simulation are summed up on these slides.
