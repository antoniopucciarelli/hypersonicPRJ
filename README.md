This project simulates the **Schiapparelli** capsule descend on Mars. 

The descend has been modeled using **SPARTA** code. 

## Simulation

The simulated cases are the following:

| Case 		| Mesh 	| Description  					| Output 						   |
|---		|--- 	|---						|---							   |
| aeroCoeffCase | 3D	| C \& O based molecules simulation without reactions	| C<sub>L</sub> \& C<sub>D</sub> analysis with respect to Mach, Knundsen and AOA |
| basicReactiveCase     | 2D	| C \& O based molecules simulation with reactions	                | Flow study |
| extendedReactiveCase	| 2D	| C, O, N \& e<sup>-</sup> based molecules simlation with reactions	| Flow study |

The results of the simulation are summed up on [these slides](https://github.com/antoniopucciarelli/hypersonicPRJ/blob/main/latex/main.pdf).
