This project simulates the **Schiapparelli** descend on Mars. 

The descend has been modeled using **SPARTA** code. 

## Simulation

The simulated cases are the following:

| Case 		| Mesh 	| Description  					| Output 						   |
| basicCase     | 3D	| $C$ \& $O$ based molecules simulation 	| $C_{L}$ \& $C_{D}$ analysis with respect to $Kn$ and AOA |
| extendedCase	| 3D	| $C$, $O$ \& $N$ based molecules simlation 	| $C_{L}$ \& $C_{D}$ analysis with respect to $Kn$ and AOA |

The results of the simulation are summed up on these slides.
